# Nodejs-REST-API-with-JWT-y-Roles-Autorizaci-n-and-Autenticaci-n-Mongodb

a educational API with Javascript and related technologies (ES6+, mongodb, etc)

# Environment variables

PORT, the default port is 3000
MONGODB_URI, the default MONGODB URI

This is a practical example of Nodejs and MongoDB in which I created a REST API that makes a CRUD of products, allows users to authenticate and establish roles for route authorization on the server.

In addition, babel will be used to use the latest Javascript features in Nodejs.
